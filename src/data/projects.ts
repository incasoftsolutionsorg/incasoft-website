    summary:
      "A connected retail platform unifying point-of-sale, inventory, customers and reporting across a multi-branch retail operation.",
    challenge:
      "Retail operations often run on disconnected tools — a POS here, a stock spreadsheet there, reports assembled by hand. Staff spend hours reconciling numbers, and management makes decisions on stale data.",
    solution:
      "A single web platform connecting billing, stock, suppliers, customers and finance. Sales update inventory in real time, managers see live dashboards, and reports generate themselves.",
    features: [
      "Fast touchscreen point-of-sale with offline fallback",
      "Real-time, multi-branch inventory tracking",

      "A real-time operations dashboard that pulls data from across the business and turns it into clear, actionable visibility.",
    challenge:
      "When key numbers live in five different systems, nobody sees the whole picture. Reporting becomes a weekly manual project instead of a daily habit, and problems surface late.",
    solution:
      "An automated analytics layer that connects existing systems through APIs, aggregates the data and presents live KPIs, trends and alerts in one clean dashboard.",
